Project Overview

This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard built using a customer-level credit card dataset. The aim of the project is to analyze and visualize revenue, interest earned, transaction amounts, and customer behavior across multiple dimensions. By transforming raw data into meaningful insights, this dashboard provides a business-friendly view that stakeholders can use for strategic decision-making.

🎯 Objectives

The primary objective of this project was to build a comprehensive reporting solution that not only presents high-level KPIs but also allows deeper exploration of customer segments and transaction patterns. The focus was on designing an intuitive interface that highlights trends, comparisons, and customer attributes in a clear, professional manner.
